<h1>The Best Movies According to Tito</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Doukyusei</h3>
<p>Loved how beautifully the simplicity of it has been shown.</p>
<h3>Dead Poet's Society</h3>
<p>"But only in his dreams can a man be truly free, t'was always thus and always thus will be."</p>
<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>Again, the simplicity of it in the first half, the second half was a little too packed for me though.</p>
